 a Macintosh ROM image to use Basilisk II.
 .
 Some features of Basilisk II:
  - Emulates either a Mac Classic (which runs MacOS 0.x thru 7.5)
    or a Mac II series machine (which runs MacOS 7.x, 8.0 and 8.1),
    depending on the ROM being used
  - Color video display
  - CD quality sound output
  - Floppy disk driver (only 1.44MB disks supported)
  - Driver for HFS partitions and hardfiles
  - CD-ROM driver with basic audio functions
  - Easy file exchange with the host OS via a "Host Directory Tree" icon
    on the Mac desktop
  - Ethernet driver
  - Serial drivers
  - SCSI Manager (old-style) emulation
  - Emulates extended ADB keyboard and 3-button mouse
  - Uses UAE 68k emulation or (under AmigaOS and NetBSD/m68k) real 68k

Description: Bayesian MCMC phylogenetic inference
 BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular
 sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured
 phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It
 can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a
 framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a
 single tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that
 each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. Included
 is a simple to use user-interface program for setting up standard
 analyses and a suit of programs for analysing the results.

Description: French and English Text-To-Speech for MBROLA
 This Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine speaks French; a preliminary English support
 is also offered.
 The engine uses context-sensitive rules to produce phonemes from the text. It
 relies on MBROLA to generate actual audio output from the phonemes. The TTS
 engine is implemented using the Python programming language.
 .
 The upstream authors have come up with this TTS to try and meet their own needs
 as blind users.
 It's designed to be plugged as output to some screen-review software, firstly
 with BRLTTY.
 They favor speed and intelligibility over perfect pronunciation.
 Cicero is aimed to have a quick response time, the ability to quickly shut-up
 and skip to another utterance, intelligibility where it counts (not perfect
 pronunciation), the ability to track speech progression, relative simplicity
 (hackability) and relative small code size.

Description: MATLAB support for Dynare
 Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in
 particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping
 generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on
 the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations
 about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able
 to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme,
 models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme,
 models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
 state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning
 process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate
 consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and
 financial intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by
 including several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned
 agent categories.
 .
 Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It
 is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model
 parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. In
 practice, the user will write a text file containing the list of model
 variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables together, the
 computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or numerical
 outputs.
 .
 This package is only useful to users having MATLAB installed on their
 machine. It contains the source of the MEX files and will recompile them using
 the existing MATLAB installation.

 ESI-X was the first stored program scientific interpreter
 for the PDP-8.
 ESI was designed by Dave Waks on 8/3/66 and was vaguely based on
 RAND's JOSS.
 In 1967 Bob Supnik extended the program to support 8KW of memory,
 and this became the "ESI-extended" or ESI-X
 FOCAL was eventually the successor of ESI-X.

Description: Interactive XAFS analysis program
 IFEFFIT is an interactive program for XAFS analysis. It combines the
 high-quality analysis algorithms of AUTOBK and FEFFIT with graphical display
 of XAFS data and general data manipulation.
 .
 IFEFFIT comes as a command-line program, but the underlying functionality is
 available as a programming library. The IFEFFIT library can be used from C,
 Fortran, Tcl, Perl, and Python. This allows a variety of user interfaces
 (both graphical and non-graphical) to be written around IFEFFIT. Currently,
 three graphical user interfaces: G.I.FEFFIT, ATHENA/ARTEMIS, and SIXPACK
 are built on the underlying IFEFFIT library. IFEFFIT and all three GUIs are
 under active development, but are fairly well tested and ready for use.

Description: LAPACK numerical subroutines translated from their Fortran 77 source
 The package provides the LAPACK numerical subroutines translated from their
  subset Fortran 77 source into class files, executable by the Java Virtual
 Machine (JVM) and for use by Java programmers.
 .
 This makes it possible for Java applications or applets, distributed on the
 World Wide Web to use established legacy numerical code that was originally
 written in Fortran.
 The translation is accomplished using a special purpose Fortran-to-Java
 (source-to-source) compiler.

Description: Java library for developing numerical applications
 MTJ is designed to be used as a library for developing numerical
 applications, both for small and large scale computations. The library
 is based on BLAS and LAPACK for its dense and structured sparse
 computations, and on the Templates project for unstructured sparse
 operations.
 .
 MTJ uses the netlib-java project as a backend, which can be set up to
 use machine-optimised BLAS libraries for improved performance of dense
 matrix operations, falling back to a pure Java implementation. This
 ensures perfect portability, while allowing for improved performance in
 a production environment.

Description: implementation of LikelihoodCore for nucleotides used by beast-mcmc
 BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular
 sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured
 phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It
 can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a
 framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a
 single tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that
 each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. Included
 is a simple to use user-interface program for setting up standard
 analyses and a suit of programs for analysing the results.
 .
 This package provides an implementation of LikelihoodCore for nucleotides
 that calls native methods for maximum speed.

Description: Task scheduler for heterogeneous multicore machines
 StarPU is a runtime system that offers support for heterogeneous
 multicore machines. While many efforts are devoted to design efficient
 computation kernels for those architectures (e.g. to implement BLAS
 kernels on GPUs or on Cell's SPUs), StarPU not only takes care of
 offloading such kernels (and implementing data coherency across
 the machine), but it also makes sure the kernels are executed as
 efficiently as possible.
 .
 This package contains an OpenCL-compatible library interface to StarPU.

 libtrain is a library for calculating the shortest route
 from a train station to another in consideration of time and distance.
 It tells you which line you should take and where you should transfer at.

 Note that this is a *library*, so you have to get interface programs using
 libtrain(gtktrain is recommended) to actually use it.
 .
 To use this software, you'll need to get the train schedule data separately
 and install it by yourself.  See README.Debian for more detail.

Description: firmware files used by the linux-wlan-ng driver
 linux-wlan-ng is a set of drivers and utilities that is intended to
 provide the full range of IEEE 802.11 MAC management capabilities for use
 in user-mode utilities and scripts. The package currently supports the
 Intersil 802.11b Prism2, Prism2.5, and Prism3 reference designs for
 PCMCIA, PCI, and USB. Additionally, the package includes support for the
 PLX9052 based PCI to PCMCIA adapter with a few different PCMCIA cards.
 .
 This package doesn't contain the firmware files, but a script to download
 the upstream source tarball and build a deb that contains them. Note that
 only some adapters really need a firmware file and that firmware files are
 not completely free (in the sense of freely redistributable), that's why
 this package exists.
 .
 For newer kernels (2.6.31+) which have the in-tree prism2_usb driver,
 you can install the prism2-usb-firmware-installer package instead.

Description: Share a file over Tor Hidden Services anonymously and securely.
 OnionShare lets you securely and anonymously share a file of any size with
 someone. It works by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor
 hidden service, and generating an unguessable URL to access and download
 the file. It doesn't require setting up a server on the Internet somewhere
 or using a third party filesharing service. You host the file on your own
 computer and use a Tor hidden service to make it temporarily accessible
 over the Internet. The other user just needs to use the Tor Browser and
 to enter the URL to download the file from you.

 Gesture' is gesture tracking for using arm movements for navigating menus, it
 provides gesture tracking for things like push, click, circle, and
 wave. 'Games for All' is skeleton tracking for getting information on the
 position of all of the joints of the body.  These two tracking modes are the
 most common kinds of tracking used with the Microsoft Kinect camera.

 prism2-usb-firmware-installer will at the time of its own installation

 .
 The downloaded file will be used as-is by the 2.6.31 kernel. If you
 have an earlier kernel you will have to install the
 linux-wlan-ng-firmware package instead.
 .
 Note that only some adapters really need a firmware file and that
 firmware files are not completely free (in the sense of freely
 redistributable), which is why this package exists.

Description: Python module to access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API
 PyCUDA lets you access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API from Python.
 Several wrappers of the CUDA API already exist–so what’s so special about
 PyCUDA?
  * Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often called
    RAII in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and crash-free
    code.  PyCUDA knows about dependencies, too, so (for example) it won’t
    detach from a context before all memory allocated in it is also freed.
  * Convenience. Abstractions like pycuda.driver.SourceModule and
    pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray make CUDA programming even more convenient than
    with Nvidia’s C-based runtime.
  * Completeness. PyCUDA puts the full power of CUDA’s driver API at your
    disposal, if you wish.
  * Automatic Error Checking. All CUDA errors are automatically translated
    into Python exceptions.
  * Speed. PyCUDA’s base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties
    above are virtually free.
  * Helpful Documentation.

Description: Python 3 module to access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API
 PyCUDA lets you access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API from Python.
 Several wrappers of the CUDA API already exist–so what’s so special about
 PyCUDA?
  * Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often called
    RAII in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and crash-free
    code.  PyCUDA knows about dependencies, too, so (for example) it won’t
    detach from a context before all memory allocated in it is also freed.
  * Convenience. Abstractions like pycuda.driver.SourceModule and
    pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray make CUDA programming even more convenient than
    with Nvidia’s C-based runtime.
  * Completeness. PyCUDA puts the full power of CUDA’s driver API at your
    disposal, if you wish.
  * Automatic Error Checking. All CUDA errors are automatically translated
    into Python exceptions.
  * Speed. PyCUDA’s base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties
    above are virtually free.
  * Helpful Documentation.
 .
 This package contains Python 3 modules.

Description: preparation of in silico drug screening projects
 The field of computational biology is all about modeling
 physiochemical entities. Structural biology is about how
 those entities look in 3D and behave. And we have a drug
 when we can change that behaviour in a way that we want it
 to be changed - and only that behaviour.
 .
 Some good part of the characterisation of promising
 drug-like compounds for their interaction with a larger protein
 can be done on computers. This package helps with getting
 collections of small ligands prepared to be fitted against
 a particular protein of known structure. That docking itself
 is then to be performed by autodock or autodock-vina.
 .
 Raccoon may not find the drug, but it may well find a
 lead to it. To have this package with Debian shall help
 smaller biochemistry labs and grants an opportunity for the
 general public to educate itself and/or actively join in to
 help the world .... just a bit.

Description: analyze and visualize phylogeographic reconstructions
 SPREAD is a user-friendly application to analyze and visualize
 phylogeographic reconstructions resulting from Bayesian inference of
 spatio-temporal diffusion.
 .
 There is a tutorial for SPREAD online at
 http://www.kuleuven.be/aidslab/phylogeography/tutorial/spread_tutorial.html
 .
 Originally this program is named "spread".  However, there is just such a
 package inside Debian and thus a 'phy' for phylogeny was prepended.

Description: Oracle SQL Developer Debian package builder
 This utility makes it possible to build a Debian package of Oracle SQL
 Developer. The Oracle SQL Developer program is governed by the copyright
 holder (Oracle USA, Inc.), so you may be limited as to what you can do with
 the resulting package (i.e. no redistribution, etc). This utility will simply
 help you create the Debian package, it is your responsibility to use the
 resulting package acordingly with the OTN license, a copy of which is included
 in the created package, that you must agree on when downloading the source.
 .
 This utility will require you to download the architecture independent archive
 from <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer>,
 identified as "Oracle SQL Developer for other platforms", "Oracle SQL
 Developer for Multiple Platforms" or "Oracle SQL Developer for Linux and Unix"
 (depending on which version you  are building), to create the Debian package
 from.

 StarPU is a runtime system that offers support for heterogeneous
 multicore machines. While many efforts are devoted to design efficient
 computation kernels for those architectures (e.g. to implement BLAS
 kernels on GPUs or on Cell's SPUs), StarPU not only takes care of
 offloading such kernels (and implementing data coherency across
 the machine), but it also makes sure the kernels are executed as
 efficiently as possible.

Description: helps download, update and run the Tor Browser Bundle
 Tor Browser Launcher is intended to make the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) easier
 to maintain and use for GNU/Linux users. torbrowser-launcher handles
 downloading the most recent version of TBB for you, in your language and for
 your architecture. It also adds a "Tor Browser" application launcher to your
 operating system's menu.
 .
 When you first launch Tor Browser Launcher, it will download TBB from
 https://www.torproject.org/ and extract it to ~/.local/share/torbrowser,
 and then execute it.
 Cache and configuration files will be stored in ~/.cache/torbrowser and
 ~/.config/torbrowser.
 Each subsequent execution after installation will simply launch the most
 recent TBB. Tor Browser will be fetched, verified and unpacked each time a new
 version of TBB is released. When you open Tor Browser Launcher after an update,
 it will download the newer version of TBB for you and extract it over your old
 TBB directory in ~/.local/share/torbrowser, so you will maintain your TBB
 bookmarks.

Description: emulator for TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P computers
 xtrs is an X-based emulator for the Tandy/Radio Shack line of Zilog
 Z-80-based microcomputers popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  It
 features cassette, floppy, and hard drive emulation, timer interrupt
 emulation, file import and export from the host operating system, support for
 most of the undocumented Z-80 instructions, and a built-in debugger.  Real
 floppy drives can be used, and, if an OSS-compatible sound driver is
 available, application-based sound can be played and real cassettes read and
 written directly through the sound card or via WAVE files.  Several hi-res
 graphics cards are emulated and, in Model 4/4P mode, mice are supported.
 There is also real-time clock, sound card, serial port, joystick, and CPU
 clock speedup emulation.
 .
 xtrs requires ROM images from the original machines.  The ROMs are
 copyrighted by Radio Shack and are not freely licensed.  (Exception: in Model
 4P mode, a freely licensed boot ROM included with this package can be used to
 boot a Model 4 operating system from a diskette image.)

Description: XvBA-based backend for VA API (AMD fglrx implementation)
 X-Video Bitstream Acceleration (XvBA), designed by AMD for its ATI/AMD Radeon
 GPU, is a future extension of the X video extension (Xv) for the X Window
 System on Linux operating-systems. XvBA API allows video programs to offload
 portions of the video decoding process to the GPU video-hardware. Currently,
 the portions designed to be offloaded by XvBA onto the GPU are motion
 compensation (mo comp) and inverse discrete cosine transform (iDCT), and VLD
 (Variable-Length Decoding) for MPEG-2, MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) and VC-1 encoded
 video.
 .
 This driver only works with the proprietary fglrx driver from AMD.
